# Swiggy Food Delivery Data Warehouse & Business Analytics Project

_A Data Cleaning, Validation, Dimensional Modelling & Business Insight Case Study_

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview

In the fast-growing food delivery ecosystem, data accuracy and analytical structure play a critical role in driving reliable business insights. Swiggy, as a large-scale food delivery platform, generates massive transactional data across multiple states, cities, restaurants, cuisines, and dishes.

This project focuses on **cleaning, validating, and transforming raw Swiggy food delivery data into a scalable analytical model** using **SQL-based data engineering techniques**. The project further derives **business KPIs and deep-dive insights** to support strategic decision-making related to revenue, customer behavior, pricing, and operational performance.

The core objective is to build a **robust star-schema data warehouse** that enables efficient reporting, BI dashboarding, and advanced analytics.

### 1.2 Objectives

The key objectives of this project are:

- To perform **end-to-end data cleaning and validation** on raw Swiggy order data
    
- To identify and handle **nulls, blanks, and duplicate records**
    
- To design and implement a **Star Schema dimensional model**
    
- To populate dimension and fact tables with clean, consistent data
    
- To calculate **business-critical KPIs** such as revenue, orders, ratings, and trends

## 2. Data Understanding & Preparation

### 2.1 Dataset Description

The raw dataset `swiggy_data` contains food delivery transaction records across multiple geographic and business dimensions.

**Key Columns Include:**

- State
    
- City
    
- Order_Date
    
- Restaurant_Name
    
- Location
    
- Category (Cuisine)
    
- Dish_Name
    
- Price_INR
    
- Rating
    
- Rating_Count
    

Each record represents a **single food order item**, capturing both transactional and customer feedback attributes.

---

### 2.2 Data Quality Challenges Identified

Before analysis, several data quality risks were identified:

- Missing values in critical business columns
    
- Blank or empty string values
    
- Duplicate transaction records
    
- Mixed granularities within a single table
    

Addressing these issues was essential to ensure **accurate aggregations, reliable KPIs, and trustworthy insights**.

---

## 3. Data Cleaning & Validation

### 3.1 Null Value Analysis

A comprehensive null check was performed across all business-critical columns, including:

- State
    
- City
    
- Order Date
    
- Restaurant Name
    
- Location
    
- Category
    
- Dish Name
    
- Price
    
- Rating
    
- Rating Count
    

This step ensured visibility into data completeness and highlighted fields requiring attention before downstream processing.

---

### 3.2 Blank & Empty String Detection

Beyond nulls, **blank and empty string values** were detected, as they often bypass standard null checks but still cause analytical inaccuracies.

Fields such as restaurant names, categories, and locations were validated to ensure meaningful values existed.

---

### 3.3 Duplicate Record Detection

Duplicate orders were identified by grouping across all **business-defining attributes**, including:

- Location details
    
- Restaurant & dish
    
- Order date
    
- Price and ratings
    

This ensured that repeat rows representing the same logical transaction were detected correctly.

---

### 3.4 Duplicate Removal Strategy

Using the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function, surplus duplicate rows were removed while **retaining exactly one clean record per unique order**.

This step ensured:

- No revenue inflation
    
- No over-counting of orders
    
- Accurate trend analysis
    

---

## 4. Dimensional Modelling (Star Schema)

### 4.1 Why Star Schema?

Dimensional modelling was chosen to:

- Improve query performance
    
- Simplify analytical logic
    
- Enable scalable BI reporting
    
- Reduce data redundancy
    
- Align with industry-standard analytics practices
    

This approach separates **descriptive attributes** into dimensions and **measurable values** into a central fact table.

---

### 4.2 Dimension Tables Created

The following dimension tables were designed and populated:

#### 1. **dim_date**

- Full Date
    
- Year
    
- Month
    
- Month Name
    
- Quarter
    
- Day
    
- Week
    

#### 2. **dim_location**

- State
    
- City
    
- Location
    

#### 3. **dim_restaurant**

- Restaurant Name
    

#### 4. **dim_category**

- Cuisine / Food Category
    

#### 5. **dim_dish**

- Dish Name
    

Each dimension contains **distinct, de-duplicated records**, ensuring consistency across the warehouse.

---

### 4.3 Fact Table Design

The central fact table `fact_swiggy_orders` stores:

- Price_INR
    
- Rating
    
- Rating_Count
    
- Foreign keys to all dimensions
    

This structure enables **multi-dimensional slicing** across time, geography, cuisine, restaurant, and dish.
